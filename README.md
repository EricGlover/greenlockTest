heroku has decided that if you don't pay for the hobby dynos then you're sol

no ssl fo you

so I'm scrapping this experimentation until I have some cash

thanks heroku

# update

seems like cloudflare offers free ssl certificates so I've signed up this

site with them and will re-attempt my experiments
